# machine-learning-101

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook with basic commands for inspecting your data.

## How to run?

In your terminal run the `run.sh` script. It will start a `jupyter/scipy-notebook` docker container that maps the current directory of the host to the `~/work` directory of the container. You can access the `Jupyter` notebook at `http://localhost:8888/?token=<token>`. The `<token>` will be printed in the console.
